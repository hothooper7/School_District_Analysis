# School District Analysis Overview

I have been tasked to help Maria determine if the potential academic dishonesty at Thomas High School had an impact on the overall analysis of all school districts.  I have replaced the data from Thomas High School with NaNs and kept the rest of the school district analysis intact. My findings are below.

## Results Based on School District

Original vs. Updated District Analysis

Original Budget:

Updated Budget:

1.	The updated analysis was not affected in a significant way.  All results were changed by less than one percent.  The ninth-grade students at Thomas High School are such a small portion of the total students that these results should be expected.
2.	The school district summary provides similar conclusions.  
    - The ranking of top and bottom schools was not affected by the update.
    - Since the Thomas High School scores were such a small portion of the overall data, this comes as no surprise.

### Changing the ninth-grade data

Significance of changing the ninth-grade data:
1.	Math and reading scores by grade – Not Significant
2.	Scores by school spending – Not Significant
3.	Scores by school size – Not Significant
4.	Scores by school type – Not Significant

Changing the ninth-grade data had such a small effect on each of the metrics that the School Board should not be concerned with the overall analysis.  Academic dishonesty should be addressed, but the overall analysis does not change the outcomes enough to be considered significant. 


## Changes to school district analysis with updated data

1.	Math and reading scores at Thomas High School changed by less than one percent.
2.  Overall passing percentages did not change more than .1%.
3.	Scores by school type showed no significant change (less than .1%) from the original to the updated analysis.
4.	Thomas High School scores were changed, but not enough to affect its overall ranking amongst the schools.
